With a few hours practice you can write impressive dashboards in a few lines of R code. Then, they can be posted online, for free (in fact, this whole tutorial is a dashboard written in R code!). We don't have time to make dashboards today, but here are some of our favourite examples.

For fun examples, check out:

* this analysis of what it's like
