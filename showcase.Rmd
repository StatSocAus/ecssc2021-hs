## Dashboards

With a few hours practice you can write impressive dashboards in a few lines of R code. Then, they can be posted online, for free. We don't have time to teach this today, but here are some of our favourite examples.

For fun examples, check out this analysis of what it's like
[to live in the lego world](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/lego-world.html),
or this [hex memory game](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/hex-memory.html),
or this tool to find the most similar players in 
[pro evolution soccer 2019](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/soccer-player-similarity.html),
or this 
[t-SNE high dimensional pokemon visualiser](https://jkunst.com/flexdashboard-highcharter-examples/pokemon/)

For more serious examples, look at this map of
[the blood banks in India](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/india-blood-banks.html),
this [3D and 4D brain MRI viewer](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/mri-images.html),
this [New Zealand trade intelligence tool](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/nz-trade-dash.html),
and this [tool for studying human physiology](https://dgranjon.shinyapps.io/entry_level/).
