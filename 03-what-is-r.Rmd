## What is R!

The R project is a huge open source software collaboration. There is a foundation team of 36 people, and contributions from thousands of people globally. You can learn more about the project by visiting this web site [https://www.r-project.org](https://www.r-project.org).

R is the language of data analysis! It is the top program used for data science today, one of the most powerful tools available, and completely free for anyone to use. 

RStudio is commercial product, but it is free to most of us, and it provides an interface to help us use the R language. 

*If R is an airplane, RStudio is the airport terminal that provides the support.*
