## Start coding!

The RStudio window has mutiple panes.

- *Console*: you can type R commands and see output
- *Help*: find out information about functions and packages. This same panel will have tabs for *showing plots* that you make, *view apps* and documents, show *files* in the folder, and *packages* used. 
- *Environment*: lists the objects that you create, such as data sets.
- *Editor*: for creating scripts to run in pieces or as a whole (like this document!)

R is a scripting language, which means that it is just like writing an essay, or a math proof. We write a script to do specific tasks, that we can run again and again, or give to someone else to run. 

*Write the R code required to add two plus two (yes, it is as simple as typing `2+2` below:*

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```

*R is like a big calculator! Try doing other math operations, like subtraction, multiplication, division, or square root and power operations.*
