## Start coding!



R is a scripting language, which means that it is just like writing an essay, or a maths proof. We write a script to do specific tasks, that we can run again and again, or give to someone else to run. 

*Write the R code required to add two plus two (yes, it is as simple as typing `2+2` below:*

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```

*R is like a big calculator! Try doing other math operations, like subtraction, multiplication, division, or square root and power operations.*
